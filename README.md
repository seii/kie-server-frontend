# redhat-bpms-frontend

This code demonstrates how it is possible to communicate with a BPMS server via a "frontend" program that could be embedded in other applications or stood up by itself as a microservice.

Please see `src/test/java/org/wildfly/bpms/frontend` for tests that describe how this code is used.
